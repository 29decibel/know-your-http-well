;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Explain the meaning of an HTTP status code. Copy httpcode.el to your
;; load-path and add to your .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'status-code)
;;
;; Then run it with M-x http-status-code
;;
;;; Code goes here:

(defconst http-codes
  '({{ HTTP_CODES }}))

;;;###autoload
(defun http-status-code (code)
  "Display the meaning of an HTTP status code"
  (interactive "nEnter HTTP code: ")
  (let ((found (assoc code http-codes)))
    (if found
        (let ((description (car (cdr found))))
          (message
           "Status code %d\nMessage: %s\nCode explanation: %s"
           code (car description) (car (cdr description))))
      (message "No description found for code: %d" code))
    ))

(provide 'status-code)

;;; status-code.el ends here
